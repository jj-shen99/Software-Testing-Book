## Test Categories

### 1. Functional Testing
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for component interaction
- System-level test scenarios
- Boundary value analysis

### 2. Performance Testing
- Response time measurements
- Load testing scenarios
- Memory usage monitoring
- Concurrent user simulation

### 3. Error Handling
- Exception testing
- Recovery scenarios
- Resource cleanup
- State recovery patterns

### 4. Test Organization
- Test suite structure
- Category-based grouping
- Priority-based execution
- Feature-based organization

## Key Features
- JUnit 5 test examples
- Thread safety testing
- Parameterized testing
- Test categorization
- Performance monitoring
- Error recovery patterns

## Usage Examples

### Running Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific category
mvn test -Dgroups="critical"

# Run performance tests
mvn test -Dgroups="performance"
```

### Test Categories
- P0: Critical path tests
- P1: Core functionality
- P2: Secondary features
- Regression: Regression test suite
- Performance: Load and stress tests

## Best Practices Demonstrated
1. Test organization and structure
2. Error handling and recovery
3. Concurrent execution testing
4. State-based testing
5. Data-driven test approaches

## Requirements
- Java 11 or higher
- JUnit 5
- Maven 3.6+

## Contributing
Follow these guidelines when adding new tests:
1. Use appropriate tags for test categorization
2. Include error recovery scenarios
3. Add performance measurements where relevant
4. Document test prerequisites and setup

## Test Result Analysis

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage report
mvn jacoco:report

# View coverage metrics
open target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

### Performance Metrics
- Response time thresholds
  * Critical paths: < 100ms
  * Data processing: < 1s
  * Batch operations: < 5s

- Concurrent Users
  * Basic load: 100 users
  * Stress test: 1000 users
  * Recovery test: 500 users

### Error Rate Analysis
- Acceptable thresholds:
  * Critical operations: 0%
  * Normal operations: < 0.1%
  * Batch processing: < 1%

### Test Report Generation
```bash
# Generate detailed test report
mvn surefire-report:report

# Generate site with all reports
mvn site
```

## Sample Test Execution
```java
// Example of running a test suite
public class TestRunner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Result result = JUnitCore.runClasses(MasterTestSuite.class);
        for (Failure failure : result.getFailures()) {
            System.out.println(failure.toString());
        }
        System.out.println("Tests successful: " + result.wasSuccessful());
    }
}
```
